    "    \n",
    "    In graph theory, a tree decomposition is a mapping of a graph into a tree that can be used to define the treewidth of the graph and speed up solving certain computational problems on the graph.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    This is a simple introduction, not very detailed description.\n",

    "    \n",
    "    In constraint satisfaction, a decomposition method translates a constraint satisfaction problem into another constraint satisfaction problem that is binary and acyclic.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    This is closely related to graph decomposition.\n",

    "    In essence, it entails performing belief propagation on a modified graph called a junction tree. The basic premise is to eliminate cycles by clustering them into single nodes."
